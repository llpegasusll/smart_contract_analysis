# smart_contract_analysis
This code helps to label a non labelled dataset in MessiQ which has 40k verified smartcontracts 
Initial evaluation was done By running contract in Slither and SmartCheck
Slither identified the vulnerable contracts perfectly so it was used to label the dataset whic was used to train for ML algorithm 
SO it helps to label the dataset and helps to perform ML based activiteis this method an be further explored by naming each attack
